This library contains the same code from ptsr, another project i did. 
But ive reworked my idea for how this library would be used so it felt right to re release it as a sort of novelty library with some more advanced and revised code

The fundamental process of the code was reworked, now able to replace any data type with any other data type. I also added a function to detect any data type 
and return it as a string with the data type's name 'integer', 'float', 'string', or 'boolean'.
